# Listening on multiple ports
In order to listen on several ports, all you have to do is to use a [JSON array](https://json.org) or a [YAML stream](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2801681) containing a different [configuration](configuration.md) object for each port to listen. Consequently, each port can have its own settings and [routing table](hostname_routing.md).

## Example
A front server, supporting HTTPS and listening on ports 80 and 443, forwarding requests to an HTTP-only server on port 3000:

### JSON configuration

```json
[
  {
    "port": 80,
    "target": 3000
  },
  {
    "port": 443,
    "target": 3000,
    "ssl": {
      "cert": "/path/to/ssl/cert.file",
      "key": "/path/to/ssl/key.file"
    }
  }
]
```

### YAML configuration

```yaml
---
port: 80
target: 3000
---
port: 443
target: 3000
ssl:
  cert: "/path/to/ssl/cert.file"
  key: "/path/to/ssl/key.file"
```
