# Custom HTTP headers
It can sometimes be useful to add some HTTP headers to the requests sent to the target servers.

Let's say that you have a remote service that needs basic authentication, but that you want to expose publicly. You could add an `Authorization` header to the proxied requests in order to let the remote service accept these requests.


## Adding HTTP headers to the proxied requests
To add an header to all the proxied requests of a target, you must use the object notation for this target, and a `headers` property providing a map of the HTTP headers to set.

!!! warning
    The HTTP headers defined in this way will replace **any** existing headers with the same name.

## Example
Adding the `Authorization` and `X-Custom-Header` HTTP headers to the requests received on port 80 and forwarded to port 3000: 

### JSON configuration

```json
{
  "port": 80,
  "target": {
    "uri": 3000,
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Basic Z29vZHVzZXI6c2VjcmV0cGFzc3dvcmQ=",
      "X-Custom-Header": "X-Value"
    }
  }
}
```

### YAML configuration

```yaml
port: 80
target:
  uri: 3000
  headers:
    Authorization: "Basic Z29vZHVzZXI6c2VjcmV0cGFzc3dvcmQ="
    X-Custom-Header: "X-Value"
```
